##Synopsis

This repository contains all the source files required to simulate the propagation dynamics of light in a discrete array of N optical fibers in Kerr media described by the one-dimensional disordered discrete Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation. The solver is based in a ABC4 symplectic integrator method -- O(h^4) accurate. 

This repository contains:

   Makefile          driver_ddnls_nonlinear_pert_ic.cpp
   abc4.cpp          matrix.cpp
